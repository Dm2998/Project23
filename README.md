Data integration for the for the cases and deaths and Countries and Territories
"
In our data analysis project, we leveraged multiple datasets to seamlessly integrate diverse sources of information. Initially, we meticulously filtered the COVID cases and deaths datasets, honing in on the data relevant to the year 2020. 
This comprehensive filtration process allowed us to construct a refined dataframe encompassing crucial metrics such as cases, deaths, and mortality rates for each European country during the pivotal year of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Subsequently, we employed this dataset to further refine our insights, creating a pivot table with indices for individual countries and territories. This table encapsulated not only the raw figures of cases and deaths but also the associated mortality rates.

By arranging this data in descending order based on COVID-19 impact in the year 2020, we generated visual illustrations that vividly highlight the varying degrees of mortality rates across European nations. This meticulous approach to data analysis provides a nuanced perspective on the diverse impacts of the pandemic, offering a valuable contribution to understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 in Europe."
